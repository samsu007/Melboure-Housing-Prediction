# Melboure-Housing-Prediction

In this Project we predict the house prices of Melbourne City using Melbourne-Housing-Prediction datasets

This is the sample project who can learn basic step by step by procedures for Machine Learning Pipelines

Here, some of the pipelines are missing(Hyperparameters Tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV) 

Most of the pipelines are covered such as (Data Preprocessing, Visualize the data to gain insights, Feature Scaling, Model Selection, Cross validation)
